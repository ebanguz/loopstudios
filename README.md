### What I learned

This is my first attempt implemeting the BEM methodology. Here is an example:

```html
<nav class="nav">
	<a class="nav__link" href="#" title="Loopstudios, Inc.">
		<svg class="nav__logo"></svg>
	</a>

	<button class="nav__hamburguer" aria-label="Main Menu"></button>

	<ul class="nav__list">
		<li class="nav__item">
			<a class="nav__link">About</a>
		</li>
		<li class="nav__item">
			<a class="nav__link">Careers</a>
		</li>
		<li class="nav__item">
			<a class="nav__link">Events</a>
		</li>
		<li class="nav__item">
			<a class="nav__link">Products</a>
		</li>
		<li class="nav__item">
			<a class="nav__link">Support</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
</nav>
```

### Continued development

I focusing in JS and Fetching data from APIs and implemented in this project.
